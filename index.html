						<h2>Computer Science Project Day</h2>
						<p>Software Engineering (SE), COS 301 is a final year module for Computer Science students at the University of Pretoria. The module's presentation integrates subject matter in a very ‘hands-on’ way. Students are expected to design and implement a software system as a project tackled by a team of four to five members. The module covers a range of SE concepts, tools, techniques and skills, team skills and competencies. Usually, a software development process's primary goal is to deliver a high-quality, reliable, innovative and cost-efficient software product. However, our educational scenario's primary goal is to teach software development and engineering. The delivery of a quality product becomes a criterion for measuring acquired proficiency.</p>

    "longDesc": "The AI Crop Prediction System aims to revolutionise the South African farming industry by transforming inefficiency into a well-oiled machine of precision. In essence, Crop Prediction seeks to bridge the gap between the present state of farming and a future where crop yielding can be done in a risk-free manner. Here's how we will achieve this: Data Collection: Weather, soil quality, crop variety, and historical yield data are collected to feed the AI model. Machine Learning Model: This AI model analyses the data to predict future crop health and yield with exceptional accuracy. User-Friendly Interface & Backend: Farmers input farm data and view predictions through a user-friendly interface. A robust backend system and database manage data processing and storage. Continuously Learning Model: The AI model is trained on historical data and can be updated with new information for ongoing improvement. The AI Crop Prediction represents a significant leap forward in agricultural technology for South Africa. By harnessing the power of AI, Crop Prediction empowers farmers to make data-driven decisions, minimise risk, and achieve greater efficiency and profitability.",
