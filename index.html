						<h2>Computer Science Project Day</h2>
						<p>Software Engineering (SE), COS 301 is a final year module for Computer Science students at the University of Pretoria. The module's presentation integrates subject matter in a very ‘hands-on’ way. Students are expected to design and implement a software system as a project tackled by a team of four to five members. The module covers a range of SE concepts, tools, techniques and skills, team skills and competencies. Usually, a software development process's primary goal is to deliver a high-quality, reliable, innovative and cost-efficient software product. However, our educational scenario's primary goal is to teach software development and engineering. The delivery of a quality product becomes a criterion for measuring acquired proficiency.</p>

	"longDesc": "Marito is a progressive web application (PWA) designed to provide seamless access to multilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and terminology banks, with a strong focus on South Africa’s official languages. The platform aims to support language preservation, cultural inclusively, and low-resource natural language processing (NLP) research by making linguistic resources accessible, interactive, and community-driven. The application offers a unified search interface where users ranging from language learners to linguists and NLP researchers can browse terms across multiple lexicons and glossaries. To ensure inclusivity and accessibility, Marito is built with offline-first capabilities, allowing users to download resources for offline use and synchronize updates when reconnected. It also provides data export options in common formats such as CSV and JSON, enabling researchers and developers to integrate these resources into their workflows. Beyond being a digital repository, Marito empowers its users to engage with the content by commenting on entries, suggesting corrections, and contributing new insights. These community contributions are sent to a central repository for moderation, ensuring that the resources remain accurate and trustworthy. This feedback loop promotes collaborative growth of linguistic datasets and directly benefits low-resource NLP development by providing validated, open-source language data. Marito goes further by offering gamification features that reward users for contributing valuable feedback and engaging with the platform, helping to build a vibrant community around multilingual knowledge. It also includes data visualization tools to show statistics such as word frequency, usage trends, and contribution patterns, giving users and researchers deeper insights into language dynamics. In addition, the platform introduces learning paths that guide users through structured journeys across languages and glossaries, supporting education, language learning, and long-term engagement. The platform is designed with scalability and future extensibility in mind. It leverages modern web technologies and follows a modular, open-source approach, enabling researchers and developers to integrate additional datasets, APIs, and advanced features. The interface is built for multilingual use, ensuring that it works seamlessly across South Africa’s official languages. A key priority of the project is accessibility and usability at scale. Marito aims to reach a broad user base by implementing features such as high-contrast mode, font customization, and responsive design, making the platform accessible to individuals with diverse needs and devices. By combining strong accessibility practices with open access to linguistic resources, Marito contributes to both language preservation and wider digital inclusion. Ultimately, Marito serves as a bridge between communities, researchers, and technology, ensuring that South Africa’s rich linguistic heritage is preserved, enhanced, and leveraged for future innovations in language technology.",

	"shortDesc": "Hands UP is an innovative application that bridges the communication gap between signers and non-signers. Using advanced AI technology, the application detects and translates sign language in real-time into both text and spoken language. The app also allows users to learn how to sign accurately and features an interactive game.",
	"longDesc": "Hands UP is a real-time ASL (American Sign Language) translation and learning application designed to make communication between signers and non-signers seamless. Using advanced image detection technology, the app recognises sign gestures and leverages custom built AI models to classify them as alphabets, numbers or glosses (sign language “words”). The recognised signs are then translated into both text and speech for user convenience. Beyond translation, Hands UP serves as an educational tool for non-signers to learn sign language accurately, at their own pace. The learning aspects are organised into categories that progress from simple, everyday words to more complex phrases and sentences. Users can keep track of their learning metrics, streak and test their knowledge with dedicated quizzes. To make learning fun and engaging, the app introduces Sign Surfers. An interactive game inspired by the popular “Subway Surfers”, reimagined with a South African twist. In Sign Surfers, players test their signing knowledge by collecting letter tokens to complete words, while live camera input helps reinforce learning in a playful, hands-on way. Recognising the importance of inclusivity, Hands UP also features a dedicated kiddies’ section, where children can explore sign language through nursery rhymes, making early exposure both educational and enjoyable. Ultimately, Hands UP is more than just a translator, it is a bridge for communication, learning and inclusivity. By doing this, we are helping to foster an inclusive environment for everyone, one sign at a time.",
