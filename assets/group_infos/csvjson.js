Unlike traditional calendar apps, Koja doesn't merely track your commitments; it evolves with you.   How Koja Stands Out:  1. Dynamic Event Scheduling: Koja recognises the fluidity of modern schedules. It schedules dynamic events based on when you're actually available, ensuring optimal productivity and balance in your day.  2.
